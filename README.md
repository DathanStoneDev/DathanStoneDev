# Hi! My name is Dathan...I swear thats my real name :upside_down_face:

### I'm a former Microbiologist and Regulatory Affairs Specialist who decided to pursue their passion for tech :computer:

:gem: I'm a Software Developer who enjoys learning as much as possible when it comes to programming. I lean towards creating backend projects that are data driven.
I love working with SQL and datasets. I tend to grab large datasets from Kaggle, clean the data and work with it from there!
I also dabble with HTML, CSS and JavaScript/React for the front end.
